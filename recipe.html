                                    <li>Note: this dough requires chilling.</li>
                                    <p>
                                    <li>Cream butter and sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Cream until light and fluffy.
                                      <br>You can also use a hand mixer. Add oil and stir until smooth. Add egg and vanilla, mix until smooth, then stir in the salt and baking soda.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Mix in oats and flour until just mixed. Stir in coconut and cornflakes, then stir in chocolate chips.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Scoop 2 tablespoon balls of cookie dough onto a cookie sheet covered in wax or parchment paper. No need to spread the balls out, you’re just going to chill them.
                                      <br>Cover with plastic wrap and chill at least one hour. (If you chill longer than 4 hours you may need to let them warm up a few minutes on the counter before baking.)</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper or silpat baking mats.
                                      <br>Place cookies 2” apart on prepared cookie sheets. Lightly press down with the palm of your hand.
                                      <br>Bake for 9-11 minutes or until the bottoms just start to turn golden brown.
                                      <br>Cool at least 5 minutes on cookie sheet before removing to rack to cool completely.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 1 month. Enjoy!</li>
